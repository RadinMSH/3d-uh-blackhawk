<h2 align="center"> 3D UH Blackhawk V[1.0.0] </h1>
Hello! These two project has been created for fun.
<p> Try rotating the scene using your single finger, or on computer, use your left mouse. </p>
<p> If you want to zoom in or out, use your mouse wheel or your two fingers. </p>

<h2 align="center"> 3D Blackhawk V[1.1.1] </h1>
<p> This project is a bit more professional than its previous version! Here is some options for it: </p>

* Scaling the helicopter
* Rotating the scene
* Choose the best quality, suitable to your ram
* Move the copter to all directions
* Reset Blackhawk positions

<p> To scale, just use your mouse wheel or double finger as allways. To rotate it, just use single finger or your holding left mouse and moving your mouse. </p>

Try to select the best quality! **Neither high, nor low**. In other words:
```js
if(RAM storage is high) {
    select higher quality;
}
else {
    select the lower one;
}
```
You can also use this helper to select the best quality:

1GB RAM: Very Low
<br />
2GB RAM: Low
<br />
4GB RAM: Medium
<br />
8GB RAM: High
<br />
16GB or more: Very High

You can even change the position of the Blackhawk, with the controller bar!
If you're using laptop or PC, don't worry; you won't need to use the controller:
<br/>
Press arrow left to move west
<br/>
Press arrow right in order to move east
<br/>
Press arrow up to move up
<br/>
Press arrow down to move down
<br/>
Press N to move north
<br />
Press S to move south
<br/>
And finally press enter to reset

The main rotors round 360 rpm(rounds per minute), and the tail rotors round 4320 rpm! But if you select higher quality, it would be reduced (obviously because your RAM storage fulls).
